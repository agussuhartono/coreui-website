      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bet you all know the Buggles‚Äô song:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-3&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe class=&#34;embed-responsive-item&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8r-tXRLazs&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every week last years we‚Äôve heard that jQuery is slowly going into nowhere, when e.g. Vue.js is striving it‚Äôs way to popularity. So is the story with the Buggles‚Äô song ‚ÄúVideo killed the radio star‚Äù, where title seems to tell everything. Latest Bootstrap Blog: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/&#34;&gt;https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the final conformation for Jquery ‚Äì bolded text tells everything: ‚ÄúBootstrap no longer depends on jQuery‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? CoreUI did the same almost year ago. It‚Äôs good to know that we‚Äôre in a good company ‚Äì what‚Äôs even more sexy is that we did it first üòä&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Webpage or an app interface means nothing if it‚Äôs not glued with sexy set of icons. You know it best. So to be honest, we‚Äôve got an answer for above question. But‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs always a ‚Äúbut‚Äù üòâ You may ask why we let more than 3000 icons to be downloaded for free? X-mas gift, Black Friday in December, New Year‚Äôs madness? No way ‚Äì from now on, you can use CoreUI icons for free. We‚Äôre open source, so it should be for free. Save your time and drag them in your design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Some say‚Ä¶ üòâ that CoreUI admin template is one of the most popular open-source admin panel template. Some may ask ‚Äì why? Because it delivers all responsive, customizable, and reusable components, you might need to create simply beautiful &amp;amp; responsive apps. But the beauty would be nothing without time-to-market. So please cordially welcome CoreUI 3.0 (beta).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no discussion that, Bootstrap is one of the most popular responsive frameworks available, since Twitter released it in 2011. Thanks to an extensive library of cutting edge components, add-ons and plugins it enables fresh ideas and unconventional approach to every next web project. So there‚Äôs no wonder then, that not more than a week ago we‚Äôve heard about Bootstrap 3.0.1, and just two days ago we‚Äôve got Bootstrap 3.0.2. But as our dear old grannies used to say: never too much of a good thing‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduced our Genius Bootstrap Admin Template. But does the name oblige? If we look at some of the features like Bootstrap 3.0.0, write with LESS and almost 1500 icon (among them Glyphicons PRO), you can easily say that Genius Bootstrap can be(come) Einstein in the world of Bootstrap templates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
